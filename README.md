We only work with functional components and avoid the use of class components _(See [Difference between functional and class components](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-functional-components-and-class-components-in-react/#:~:text=A%20functional%20component%20is%20just,method%20used%20in%20functional%20components.))_. Consider the following tutorials/documentations to get started:
